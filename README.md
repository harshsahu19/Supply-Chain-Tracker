# Supply Chain Tracker

## Project Description

Supply Chain Tracker is a blockchain-based application that provides complete transparency and traceability for products throughout their journey from manufacture to end consumer. Built on Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts, this system allows stakeholders to track product ownership, location, and status changes in real-time with immutable records.

The application enables manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers to verify product authenticity, track shipping progress, and maintain a permanent audit trail of all transactions and movements within the supply chain.

## Project Vision

To revolutionize supply chain management by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, secure, and efficient system that:

- **Eliminates counterfeiting** by providing verifiable product authenticity
- **Increases consumer trust** through complete supply chain visibility
- **Reduces fraud** with immutable transaction records
- **Improves efficiency** by automating tracking and verification processes
- **Enables accountability** at every step of the supply chain
- **Facilitates quick resolution** of quality issues through precise tracking
